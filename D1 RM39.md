- Compound sorting, 
- Aggregation, 
  - Pipeline and Stages -> $match, $group
  - Operators
- Theory - Choose Wisely -> which data base need to choose based on the purpose
  - Q: Do one DB is enough for a company and why?
  - A: no, because one DB can't provide the best in both reading and writing. So based on the situation's DB's as been choosed
  - Q: Reading and Writing which is fast in MDB 
  - A: Reading, all noSQL DB are faster in reading

`[00:09]`**Today's Topic's**

- CRUD - Update & Delete
- MongoDB & Nodes - Overall architecture
- Node intro

        CRUD - Update & Delete in VSCode -> Update all, find, Update one, find one, delete all, delete one, null
        
  - The duplicate can find only through aggregation.

`[00:30]` -> [Link -> Delete the Duplicate](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26984799/find-duplicate-records-in-mongodb)

```Java Script
          db.collection.aggregate([
            {$group:{_id:'$name', count:{$sum:1}}},
            {$match:{_id:{$ne:null},count:{$gt:1}}},
            {$project:{name:'$_id', _id:0}},
           ]
          );
```
- - then we can use the id to delete the duplicate
- Find the other uses for Aggregation

`[00:33]` ***Overall architecture***

- - in any product there will be two layer, application layer and data layer

- - joining the Froundend and Data is Backend, here done by NodeJs
  - Backend Languages frame work
    - NodeJs - +Express,
    - Java   - +Spring Boot, 
    - Python - +Django,
    - PHP    - +Laranel, 
    - .net   - .razor, (.net microsoft)
    - GO (GO google)
    - Ruby of Rails/ROR

  - C, C++ System level language -> OS, Drivers, Chrome, Gaming(unreal engine -> predefined physics)
  - NodeJs is widely used because it is developer friendly, in term of performance wise GO is leading but it is not developer friendly as NodeJs
  - Phython is morely used for machine language, data science

- - Request from frountend to backend
    - REST standard Get, Post, Put, Delete on Api's
    - REST is the common language for all Backend languages, all backend will support REST
    - JSON is the universal language because of string datatype, so it is understandable to all backend languages

  - Query writen as command in NodeJs -> Server -> Storage Engine
    - Ex: db.movies.find({}) 
    - Query from Backend to Server, then to Storage Engine
      - Storage Engine first check wheather the data is in RAM, if it as the data then it will return to Server, then to Backend
      - if RAM does not have the copy of the data, it will return the data from hard disk to Server, then to Backend
      - Once the backend gets the data it will return to froundend
    - Storage Engine decides the data should be store in RAM or not form harddisk(HDD)

  - Drivers: 
    - It helps to understand any backend language for MongoDB Server, MDB is Js language
    - In case of NodeJs in backend -> 
      - NodeJs it self is in Js language
      - The driver layer of the NodeJs is thin compare to other laguages 
      - Because of MDB also in Js lang.
      - This thin Driver layer or Drivers convert the data into promises, so it will be easy to developers to handle it.

- In Application layer Frountend, Backend in Js and in data layer Server in Js while we use React, NodeJs, MongoDB respectively. This is MERN stack, one language rule the entire stack in case of MERN. Early 3languages needs to be known  to be known to become a FSD.

        Interview Q: Event Loop, Promises, Asynchronised, ES6 Syntax, AsyncAwait, difference between === and ==, copy by value and copy by reference, isNaN() vs Number.isNaN() arrow vs normal function, MRF, var vs let vs const, prototype vs proto, this Keyword
`[01:06]`[Link -> Interview Question](https://ragavkumarv.com/blog/all/)

- MongoDB is acessed using MongoDB Shell, from now NodeJS as been used to access MDB. MongoDB Shell -> Playground/Administration.

- Why Backend is required, earlier no frountend or backend seggregation, why do we seggregate?
  - The Advantage is Loose Coupling, Stack is divided into froundend, backend, database. Due to more availablity of language each area of stack can be developed with any language and changing or choosing of the language for a particular area of stack is possible without distrubing other parts of stack. Earlier, it was tight coupling, if any change of language was made in any part of the stack, will affects other parts. So now the other parts of the stack needs to be adjusted according to new changes made in particular part of the stack.
  - For android, IOS froudend language is different. So with the help of Loose coupling, only the frontend needs to be changed without any changes in backend and viseversa
  - But if any changes of language in DB will affect the backend, it can be deal with the help of Prism called ORM -> Object Relational mapping.

  - Frountend
    - React - Web
    - Kotlin - Android
    - Swift - IOS
      - All the above frountend can be understand by backend and all the backend languages can be understand by DB but if any change of language in DB can be understand only with the help of prism called ORM.
      - change of DB: changing from Mongodb to plspl
  - Micro Service: a single backend writened in multiple languages

- What is NodeJs
- Why NodeJs
- Limitation of Browser
- Famous Viruses 
- NodeJs Usage
- JsFundamentals revision
- NodeJs Architecture
- Project Setup
- Common items
- Difference
- Inbuilt Pacakages
          
- ***What is NodeJs***
  - Server is one of the use case of NodeJs and NodeJs is not the server
  - It is a environment/place to run Js also know as Js run time
  - Js engine of NodeJs was adopted from browser engine ie Js engine of the browser
  - In browser Js can be run, even though we need NodeJs to run Js because browser can't do CRUD automatically due to access is restricted for privacy purposes
    - cannot access system file      - read
    - cannot access hardware details - read
    - cannot edit, copy files        - update
    - cannot delete files            - delete
    - can creat while download, but can't be create any other data without permission - create
  - for saftly and privacy Browser are restricted to do CRUD operation
  - But the CRUD needs to be done, done through another environment ie, Server
  - There is some of the virus that can do CRUD illigaly

- Famous Virus: love virus, Worm virus, Randsome virus, shortcut virus -> shortcut virus come from pendriver but other virus are from web

        Node Js Usage: Data Streaming, Server-side proxy, Big_data and Analytics, Wireless Connectivity, System Monitoring Dashboard, Real-time data, Queued I/O Inputs, Char Bots, web Scraping and automation, REST API.

          Js is Single Thread or Multi Thread?
            Single Thread and Asynchronised
              single threat - execute Js line one by one
          Sync and Async?
            Synchronised function - execute by ordered function
            Asynchronised function - execute by unordered function, simultanious execution of multiple function
            - cuncurrent function - Asynchronised
            - parllel function - multithread

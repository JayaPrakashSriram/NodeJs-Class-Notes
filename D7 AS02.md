`[00:12]` ***Connecting Netlify, Vercel, Atlas***
- In React: Browser -> Inspect -> Network - Headers -> General -> Request URL
  - Changing the link to connect the node by code it into Global variable
  - using the Global Varibale we can change all the links in the react in single short to connect with node
  - Copy the Request URL leaving /movies. orginal "'react api link'/movies"
  - Create a folder global.js and code Export const API = 'react api link'
  - Here we can use the props but here purpose of the props is not needed. props used when the data changes dynamically or for a toggle logic
  - Use the Request URL and search it for similar links in react app. 
  - Replace all the link with Global variable using template literal syntax ${API}
  - Import on all the file, where changes on the link as been made. 
  - Import as been done by selecting the suggestion from the drop down when we edit the word API in template literal
  - while import and export .js should be added in node but not in react

  - the link in global.js as to be changed into https//:localhost:4000 to maintain a commanality on link between app's

`[00:28]` ***Start the node app***

    - from export const API = 'react API link';
    - to export const API = "https//:localhost:4000";

  - now if we use the react app it will throw the error -> error: CORS
    - CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    - Here node is trying to protect from react due to the different orgin
    - Orgin: react - 5173; node - 4000;
    - To fix it we need a package name cors npm

`[00:35]` -> [Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

        !@#$%

`[00:43]` 
- before deployment we need to change the localhost url to vercel url
